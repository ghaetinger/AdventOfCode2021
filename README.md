# Advent Of Code 2021

A Haskell based approach for the AoC 2021 problems.

I would like to thank my dad **Ricardo Haetinger** for giving me tips on how to finish day 14 (although unwanted at first, they were needed).

There are a few solutions that do not have optimal time (Days 19, 23, 25), most of which are due to using non-lazy functions or just simply because I decided to brute force them. This leads to test execution time getting to ~3min.
